# Problem Statement
Lack of appointing hr staffs in medium sized enterprises always raises the question of authenticity,as there exists no communication channels for the company staffs to enquire about their queries or others to know about the details on new recruitments.
To get rid of this prevailing challenge,we have developed a smart HR-gpt that can automate the tasks done by an HR personnel such as responding to employee queries on leave requests,salary,incentives and other allowances. It also does the work of verifying CVs, shortlisting candidates and scheduling their interviews.
