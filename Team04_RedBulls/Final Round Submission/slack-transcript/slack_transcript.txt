----Problem Statement ----
Lack of appointing HR staffs in medium sized enterprises always raises the question of authenticity,as there exists no communication channels for the company staffs to enquire about their queries or others to know about the details on new recruitments.
To get rid of this prevailing challenge,we have developed a smart HR-gpt that can automate the tasks done by an HR personnel such as responding to employee queries on leave requests,salary,incentives and other allowances. It also does the work of verifying CVs, shortlisting candidates and scheduling their interviews.

Will it be good if we add voice typing to our chatbot?
9:41
What's ur suggestion


HW
Haritha Tony
  9:42 AM
Yeah, Voice typing is a good option
9:43
I think we should add a file attachments section so employees can upload their documents like sick leave, resumes etc

All team members try your max not to use open ai api

Doing so would reduce the cost of our project

Hello!
4:09
I apologize for the late response, I did not get notified that you pinged me.

How can I help with the OpenAI api?
Are you looking for documentation, templates, examples?

# Update # 2:
It has been brought to my attention that using OpenAI and Claude models may be a barrier due to costs. To relieve this burdon on all teams, I have created API keys that all teams can use for their development.
OpenAI:
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
Claude:
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
*Note:* These keys will be deleted after the competition.

Unfortunately the original OpenAI Key was automatically revoked by OpenAI. They found that it was uploaded to GitHub and considered it leaked. Please see a new, working key below and remember to keep it in a safe place (do not push to Git).
