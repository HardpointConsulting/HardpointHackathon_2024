Automated Customer Interaction and Ordering system
Our automated customer interaction system aids online brands in seamlessly engaging with customers. Although we have not yet completed the automatic ordering system due to time constraints, this feature remains a potential addition in the future.


Key Features:

Automated Responses: Our system enables online brands to automatically respond to user comments on Instagram, ensuring a contextual understanding of each interaction.

Direct Message Handling: The system also manages direct messages (DMs) from customers on Instagram, providing relevant responses.

The bot's adaptability allows for customization based on the individual brand's characteristics, leading to more precise and effective outcomes.
