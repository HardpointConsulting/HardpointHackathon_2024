"During my diurnal cycling commute, even amidst the zenith of traffic congestion, the jacket's exceptional breathability facilitated excellent thermal regulation, preventing unwelcome internal hyperthermia. While I extend my plaudits to the design team for this ingenious creation, the material's remarkable tactility appears to be compromised by a propensity for accelerated degradation.", 21 March 2024
"I recently purchased this Sunscreen Jacket, and it has quickly become a staple in my wardrobe. The jacket's UPF50+ protection is a standout feature, making it perfect for summertime outings. It's a reliable shield against the sun's harsh rays, allowing me to stay comfortable and protected during sunny days.The jacket's comfort level is impressive, and the attention to detail is evident in its design. It fits accurately to the size of the t-shirt you wear, ensuring a snug yet not constricting fit. Plus, the addition of a pouch for the jacket is a thoughtful touch, making it convenient to carry it on the go.However, one thing to keep in mind is that this jacket isn't designed for rainy weather. It lacks the water resistance needed to withstand heavy rain, so you'll want to have an umbrella or another rainproof option at hand.Another aspect to consider is the jacket's material, which is quite thin. While this contributes to its comfort, it does require some care to maintain its quality over time. Be cautious to avoid snags or tears, as the fabric is delicate.In terms of price, it falls within a reasonable range, but it could be even more attractive to buyers if it were a bit more budget-friendly. Perhaps a price point of 900-1000₹ would make it an even better value, given its excellent sun protection capabilities.In summary, the Sunscreen Jacket is a fantastic addition to your wardrobe for protection from the sun and versatile use in various weather conditions. Just be mindful of its limitations in rain, and handle it with care to make it last. With a slight price adjustment, it could be a more appealing choice for those seeking daily quality protection.", 17 October 2023
"Just got the ""Blue Tyga Sunscreen Jacket,"" and it's super nice ✨1. The jacket is extremely lightweight and comfy, perfect for hot days.2. Unique Product: For a country with tempratures and heat as high as ours , it's strange that there are not many products in the market that helps out with this. This product fills that gap by providing extremely good sun protection all the while being super lightweight3.  Sun Protection: This jacket really blocks the sun's harmful rays.4. Well Packaged: When my order arrived, I was pleased to find the jacket neatly packed in its own cover. This attention to detail shows that the company cares about its customers and the quality of their products.5. Good Fit: Looks good and the super nice as well. (Had to exchange for one size up , but the exchange process was hassle free)Really cool product, would definitely recommend 💫", 5 September 2023

Its a useful product for bikers in summer but its Overpriced not worth the amount, 24 March 2024

"At this price the zip quality is very poor. It feels like if you put a little more force, it will come out in your hand.Zipper is not smooth at all.Stitching is very poor, won't last for a 2-3 weeks of regular use.Manufacturing is cheap quality. Not worth 1500 at all.", 5 February 2024
Not worth, 20 February 2024
It is good for sun protection. But zipper quality is subpar. One pocket is already stuck and gone after a days use. Even the main zipper seems flimsy and easily breakable., 29 January 2024

"I have tried multiple jackets for summer but every jacket have its own issue either heavy or major is swetting in jams. Guys this is perfect jacket meant for summer, with best fitting. Save from swetting & actually this is breathable. Best part is you can just fold it & keep in your laptop bag. Must buy if you use bike for office communicating & want to save yourself from dust & swetting.", 11 August 2023
I really like it, 26 December 2023
"The media could not be loaded.Used it for couple of days only. Its a cheap fabric, already pilled at several places, fabric is very sensitive and we have to use it while driving. Stiching is very poor, we can see loose ends several places. Zip is getting stuck from day one. Within two days the material looks very old used material. Overall this jacket wont last for more than a month.  This is my honest opinion. Thankyou.", 19 January 2024

Could reduce the pricing, 19 November 2023
Jacket is not as exactly mentioned in the commercial its way too thin and heat is transfered to the skin easily. Also it has only 2 pockets whi h I feel a disadvantage.The price we pay do not justify the quality and the satisfaction goes down to 0., 19 December 2023
The media could not be loaded.With one wash only got this kind of bubbles. Don't know how many days will come., 25 March 2024
