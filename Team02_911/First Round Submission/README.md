# Scientific Document Title and Author Extraction System

## Overview
This system is designed to automatically extract title and author information from scientific documents and generate alternative titles based on the document content. It utilizes Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text from images of scientific documents, preprocesses the extracted text, and then employs a Generative AI model to generate alternative titles.

## Features
- **Title and Author Extraction:** Extracts title and author information from scientific documents using OCR.
- **Preprocessing:** Preprocesses extracted text to enhance accuracy and remove noise.
- **Alternative Title Generation:** Generates alternative titles based on the content of the document using a Generative AI model.
- **User Feedback:** Allows users to provide feedback on generated titles for further refinement.
