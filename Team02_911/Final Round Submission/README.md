## GenCraft: AI-Powered Marketing Assistant for SMEs

**GenCraft** is an open-source project that utilizes generative AI to empower small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with a user-friendly marketing assistant.  Our goal is to help SMEs create high-quality, on-brand marketing content that resonates with their target audience, without requiring extensive technical expertise or resources.

###   **Problem:**

SMEs often struggle with creating engaging and effective marketing content due to limitations in time, budget, and marketing expertise.

###   **Solution:**

GenCraft leverages generative AI and automation to streamline content creation for SMEs:

* **Generate creative content:** LangChain or LaMDA will be used to generate marketing copy based on user input (target audience, keywords, desired tone). 
* **Maintain brand consistency:** Train the AI model on user-provided brand guidelines and past marketing materials to ensure consistent brand voice. 
* **Easy-to-use interface:** No coding skills required. A simple interface guides users through the content creation process.
* **Data-driven insights (Optional):** Integrate sentiment analysis and A/B testing capabilities to help users refine their content strategy.

### Ô∏è  **Technology Stack:**

* Generative AI: LangChain or LaMDA
* Custom Coding (Frontend Interface)
* Machine Learning (Optional: Sentiment Analysis, A/B Testing)

###   **Target Users:**
