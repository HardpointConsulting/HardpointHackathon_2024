GenCraft: AI-Powered Marketing Assistant - README.md

Welcome to GenCraft!

GenCraft is an open-source project that empowers small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with an AI-powered marketing assistant. It utilizes generative AI to help you create high-quality, on-brand marketing content that resonates with your target audience, without requiring extensive technical expertise or resources.

This README will guide you through setting up and running GenCraft to generate creative marketing copy.

Prerequisites:

Python 3.x (Download from https://www.python.org/downloads/)
Required Libraries (install using pip install <library_name>):
requests
beautifulsoup4 (for optional website text extraction)
textblob (for optional sentiment analysis)
Optional Libraries (depending on your chosen NLP model):

Specific libraries for your chosen NLP model (e.g., transformers for using pre-trained models like BERT)
Obtaining the Code:

Clone this repository using Git:

Bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/gencraft.git
Use code with caution.

 Replace your-username with your actual GitHub username.

Alternatively, download the zip file from the project releases and extract it.

Setting Up API Credentials (Optional):

If you plan to integrate with a generative AI API like LangChain or LaMDA, you'll need to obtain API access credentials and update the code accordingly. Refer to the specific API documentation for instructions on acquiring credentials.
Running GenCraft:

Navigate to the GenCraft project directory in your terminal.

Basic Content Generation:

Bash
python app.py
Use code with caution.

 This will run the GenCraft application. A basic web interface will be launched at http://localhost:5000 in your web browser.

Using the Web Interface:

Enter your target audience (e.g., "Young professionals").
Provide relevant keywords for your content (e.g., "healthy meal prep, easy recipes").
Select the desired content tone (informative, persuasive, humorous).
Click the "Generate Content" button.
The generated content will be displayed on the webpage.

Optional Features:

Brand Consistency Training (if implemented):

This feature requires additional setup to train the AI model on your brand data (brand guidelines, past marketing materials). The specific instructions will depend on the chosen NLP model and training approach.

Data-Driven Insights (if implemented):

This functionality involves integrating with sentiment analysis APIs or building NLP models. Refer to the relevant libraries' documentation for setup instructions.

Important Notes:

This is a basic setup guide. The actual implementation might involve additional configurations or dependencies based on your chosen NLP model and functionalities.
Consider using virtual environments (e.g., venv) to isolate project dependencies and avoid conflicts with other Python libraries on your system.
